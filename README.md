# BGA-APP
Golf webapp that displays scores and averages of players and courses and allows for score uploads. Made for fun with mySQL, C#, and vueJS (continually a work in progress)

## Setup

Clone the repo and in the root directory run ``` npm install ``` to install the dependencies. You will also need to create a dbConnection.cs file in C# to store the connection string and credentials for your MySQL db.

Once this is done you can start the backend from your IDE and run ```npm run serve``` to start the application. You will then be able to access it at localhost:8080.
